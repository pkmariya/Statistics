        "\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used in various industries to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (hypothesis) about a population.\n",
        "Here are several industry-based examples of hypothesis testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.Pharmaceuticals: Drug Efficacy**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scenario**: A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug to treat a specific medical condition and wants to determine if the drug is more effective than the existing treatment. Hypothesis:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Null Hypothesis (H0)*: The new drug is equally effective as the existing treatment.\n",
        "* *Alternative Hypothesis (H1)*: The new drug is more effective than the existing treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test**: A clinical trial is conducted, and statistical tests are performed to analyze the data and determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.Finance: Investment Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scenario**: A financial analyst proposes a new investment strategy that claims to outperform the current market average. Hypothesis:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Null Hypothesis (H0)*: The new investment strategy does not outperform the market average.\n",
        "* *Alternative Hypothesis (H1)*: The new investment strategy outperforms the market average.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test**: Historical data is collected and analyzed using statistical tests to assess whether the returns from the proposed strategy are significantly different from the market average.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Manufacturing: Production Process Improvement**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scenario**: A manufacturing plant implements changes to its production process with the goal of reducing defects in the final product. Hypothesis:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Null Hypothesis (H0)*: The changes to the production process do not reduce defects.\n",
        "* *Alternative Hypothesis (H1)*: The changes to the production process reduce defects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test**: Data on defect rates before and after the changes are collected, and statistical tests are performed to determine if there is a significant improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "In each of these examples, hypothesis testing provides a structured approach to assess claims or changes within different industries, helping decision-makers make informed choices based on statistical evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis Testing starts with the formulation of these two hypotheses:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Null hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no significant difference between the observed sample and the general population or between two samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Alternate hypothesis (H₁)**: Claims there is some statistical significance between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining the hypothesis is often complicated so we can follow these rules to correctly formulate both the hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The null hypothesis always has the following signs: =  OR   ≤   OR    ≥\n",
        "\n",
        "The alternate hypothesis always has the following signs: ≠   OR  >   OR    <\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 1**: Zomato claimed that its total valuation in December 2023 was at least $500 million. Here, the claim contains ≥ sign (i.e. the at least sign), so the null hypothesis is the original claim.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 2**: Zomato claimed that its total valuation in December 2023 was greater than $500 million. Here, the claim contains > sign (i.e. the ‘more than’ sign), so the null hypothesis is the complement of the original claim.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Making a Decision\n",
        "Once you have formulated the null and alternate hypotheses, we have to decide to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say Maruti has to buy tires for it's cars from a tire manufacturer. The tire manufacture claims that life of their tire is 36 months. Now we have to find out whether they are correct or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* Null hypothesis (H₀) : Life of tire = 36 months\n",
        "* Alternate hypothesis (H₁) : Life of tire != 36 months\n",
        "\n",
        "Now Maruti tests 100 tires and the average comes to be 32 months. So do we accept their claim or reject it. If average comes 28 months then what?\n",
        "\n",
        "For this case we define critical region. Upper and lower critical region. If the average is less than lower critical value and more than upper critical value then we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The formulation of the null and alternate hypotheses determines the type of the test and the position of the critical regions in the normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can tell the type of the test and the position of the critical region on the basis of the ‘sign’ in the alternate hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ≠ in H₁    →   Two-tailed test        →     Rejection region on both sides of distribution\n",
        "   < in H₁    →   Lower-tailed test     →     Rejection region on left side of distribution\n",
        "   > in H₁    →   Upper-tailed test     →     Rejection region on right side of distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps to perform Hyposthesis Testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Formulate the Hypotheses** The first step is to clearly define the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between the observed sample and the general population or between two samples.\n",
        "* Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference or effect that is not due to chance alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Select the Significance Level (α)** The significance level (α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Commonly used α levels are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   **Collect and Analyze Data** Data collection can be done through random sampling or experimental design. The data must be relevant to the hypotheses and collected in a way that minimizes bias. Once collected, the data is analyzed to summarize its main characteristics, often through descriptive statistics or visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   **Calculate the Test Statistic** The test statistic is a numerical value calculated from the sample data that, under the null hypothesis, follows a known distribution. The choice of test statistic depends on the nature of the data and the hypothesis being tested. Common tests include t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA, among others.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   **Determine the Critical Region or Calculate the P-value**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Critical Region**: This approach involves comparing the test statistic to critical values that define regions where the null hypothesis would be rejected. The critical values are determined based on the significance level and the distribution of the test statistic.\n",
        "* **P-value**: Alternatively, the p-value approach calculates the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the value calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
        "**We prefer using the p-value method over the critical-region method.**\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   **Make a Decision**\n",
        "\n",
        "If the test statistic falls within the critical region or the p-value is less than or equal to α, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
        "If the test statistic does not fall within the critical region or the p-value is greater than α, do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   **Draw Conclusions** Finally, interpret the results in the context of the original research question or business problem. This involves stating whether the findings support the alternative hypothesis and discussing the implications of the results for the problem at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Z-Test**\n",
        "Jeep, a well-known car maker, claims that its car 'Compass' gives a mileage of at least 17 km/litre.\n",
        "\n",
        "Null Hypothesis : μ ≥ 17\n",
        "Alternate Hypothesis : μ < 17\n",
        "Google claims that its internet browser ‘Chrome’ is the best in the industry, as it has an optimum boot time of only 250 ms, with a standard deviation of 9 ms. Sam, a tech geek, wanted to test the claim of Google. So, he randomly collected boot time data of 165 devices of Chrome and got a sample mean of 247 ms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ho: μ = 250, i.e., the mean boot time is 250 ms.\n",
        "Ha: μ ≠ 250, i.e., the mean boot time is not 250 ms.\n",
        "For Z-Test these two conditions should be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "Condition 1: n >30, which means that the population sample size should be greater than 30 observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Condition 2: 𝝈 is known, i.e., the population standard deviation is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "If any of these conditions are not met then we use t-test.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step is to determine the test statistic. A test statistic, in simple terms, is a value that is to be calculated from some given data, which is then used to compare the results arrived at with the tabular values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test statistic for a normal distribution or a Z-test is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Z = x−μ / σ/√n\n",

        "If the calculated Z-statistic is in the region of acceptance, you fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the calculated Z-statistic lies outside the region of acceptance, i.e., in the critical region, you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, the test statistic value is -4.3, which lies outside the region of acceptance of ±1.96. So, you reject the null hypothesis."

        "#### Important Note\n",
        "Beyond choosing a hypothesis test, it is important to understand whether the data you have meets the assumptions of the test you want to run. Each hypothesis test has a unique set of assumptions, however, there is one assumption that all hypothesis tests share: the data was randomly sampled from the population of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important because random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population in terms of observed (and unobserved) characteristics. Unfortunately, there may be situations where random sampling is impossible, but it is important to understand how this can bias results of a test.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let’s return to the example with the yogurt company “The Dairy Culture”. Let’s say the company had multiple factories, but the quality assurance team only collected yogurts from one specific factory. The data is thus not randomly sampled from the entire population that we care about (all factories), and could be biased if the quality of yogurt differs at each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "There can also be ethical issues that arise when a sample is not representative of a population. When developing and testing a vaccine, for example, researchers must make sure to find volunteers from an appropriate proportion of genders, races, age ranges, pre-existing conditions, and so on to test efficacy for the entire population that the vaccine will be used on. If the vaccine manufacturers test on a sample that doesn’t include sufficient data for one race, there is a risk that there could be reduced (if during the initial research phase) or unknown efficacy for that group.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can often be challenging to find a representative sample or even to recognize when there is biased data, but it is essential to think about when designing an experiment."
