        "1. Simple random sampling\n",

        "**1. Simple Random Sampling**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition**: Simple random sampling is a probability sampling method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method ensures that the sample is unbiased and representative of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: A researcher wants to survey 100 students out of a school of 1000 students about their food preferences. Each student is assigned a number from 1 to 1000, and a random number generator is used to pick 100 numbers. The students corresponding to these numbers are surveyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**: Use simple random sampling when you have a complete list of the population and want to ensure that every member has an equal chance of being selected. It is suitable for small to moderately sized populations where the list of members is accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Stratified Sampling**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition**: Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This method ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: A researcher studying the GPA of college students might divide the population into strata based on majors (e.g., English, Science, Engineering) and then randomly select students from each major in proportion to their representation in the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**: Use stratified sampling when the population has distinct subgroups, and you want to ensure that each subgroup is represented. It is particularly useful when there are significant differences between strata that could affect the study's outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Systematic Sampling**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition**: Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method where the researcher selects every nth member from the population list after a random starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: A researcher wants to survey 200 customers out of a population of 2000. They decide to select every 10th customer after randomly choosing a starting point between 1 and 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**: Use systematic sampling when you have a large, ordered population and want to ensure an even spread of the sample across the population. It is suitable for large populations where a complete list is available, and random selection is impractical.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Cluster Sampling**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition**: Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters, usually based on geographical or organizational boundaries, and then randomly selecting entire clusters for the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: A researcher studying the health outcomes of school children might divide the population into clusters based on schools. They then randomly select a few schools and include all students from those schools in the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**: Use cluster sampling when the population is large and geographically dispersed, making it impractical to conduct simple random sampling. It is suitable for studies where the population is naturally divided into clusters."

        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics and plays a crucial role in data science. It states that, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed for sufficiently `large sample sizes(n > 30)`.\n",

        "**It says**:\n",

        "1. Take any Data.\n",
        "2. Make multiple samples with replacement from the dataset. Each sample size must be more than 30 (the bigger the sample size, the better).\n",
        "3. Suppose we took 500 or 1000 samples from the data, now take means of all the various samples we have taken.\n",
        "4. We get 500 or 1000 sample means. We plot the sample means and check the distribution of the sample means. This is also known as 'Sampling Distribution of Sample Mean'.\n",
